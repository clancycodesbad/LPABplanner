# LPAB Course Planner

A lightweight, interactive drag-and-drop progression planner built specifically for the NSW Legal Profession Admission Board (LPAB) Diploma in Law.

This tool helps students map out their 20-subject progression (17 compulsory, 3 electives), tracks progress toward graduation, and automatically detects lecture and exam timetabling clashes.

unashamedly vibe coded, because i sure as hell couldnt do it otherwise.

## Features

- **Drag-and-drop interface** — Move subjects from the pool into semesters or the Already Completed section
- **Graduation tracker** — Real-time progress bars for compulsory subjects and electives
- **Clash detection** — Warns when two subjects in the same semester share a lecture night. In the current semester, once its exam timetable is published, warns when two subjects share an exam time. In any other semester, flags a possible exam clash when the pair has shared an exam slot in a published timetable before
- **Historical exam archive** — Subjects placed in future semesters show their last known exam date from `archive.js`, and past timetables in `archive.js` drive the possible-clash warnings
- **Auto-save** — Plan is saved to `localStorage` and persists across page reloads
- **Markdown export** — One-click copy of the full plan, formatted for Notion, Obsidian, or similar tools
- **Print view** — `Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P` hides the UI and formats the plan for A4 or PDF
- **Dark mode** — Follows system preference by default; manual 🌙/☀️ toggle in the toolbar

## Running the App

No build tools, no server, no installation required. The app is plain HTML/CSS/ES6 modules.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mercsal/LPABplanner.git
```

Then open `index.html` in any modern browser. Because the project uses ES6 `import`/`export`, it must be served over HTTP — it will not work if opened directly as a `file://` URL.

The simplest way to serve it locally:

```bash
# Python (built into macOS/Linux)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node (if you have npx)
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

> **Single-file version:** A self-contained `LPABPlannerApp.html` exists in the [`html file version`](./html%20file%20version/) folder for offline sharing or demos. It is a snapshot and is **not** kept in sync with the main codebase. See the README in that folder for details.

### Module responsibilities

| File | Responsibility | Imports from |
|---|---|---|
| `subjects.js` | Subject list, `currentTerm` | Nothing |
| `archive.js` | Historical exam data | Nothing |
| `engine.js` | Validation, clash detection | `subjects.js`, `archive.js`, `datetime.js` |
| `js/state/storage.js` | localStorage only | Nothing |
| `js/state/planner-state.js` | Plan mutations | `engine.js`, `storage.js`, `subjects.js` |
| `js/utils/datetime.js` | Date parsing + comparison | Nothing |
| `js/ui/ui-board.js` | Board rendering, drag-and-drop | `planner-state.js`, other UI modules |
| `js/ui/ui-pool.js` | Subject pool rendering | `planner-state.js`, `ui-board.js` |
| `js/ui/ui-progress.js` | Progress bars | `planner-state.js` |
| `js/ui/ui-toolbar.js` | Export, print | `planner-state.js` |

**Rule:** UI modules never import from each other except through `ui-main.js`. Data modules (`subjects.js`, `archive.js`) never import from anything.

## Updating for a New Semester

When the LPAB releases a new Evening Lecture Schedule and Examination Timetable, only two files need to change: `subjects.js` and `archive.js`. No logic or UI code needs to be touched.

### Step 1 — Archive the outgoing semester

In `archive.js`, add an entry for the semester that just ended, with every subject that was examined that term. This preserves its exam dates so the planner can show "Last ran" information for future semesters, and lets it flag pairs of subjects that shared an exam slot as possible clashes in later semesters.

```js
// archive.js
export const historicalExams = {
    winter2026: [
        { id: '01', exam: '8 Sep 2026, 9.00 am' },
        { id: '02', exam: '4 Sep 2026, 9.00 am' },
        // ... all subjects that ran this term
    ],
    // previous terms...
};
```

### Step 2 — Check `currentTerm` (no edit needed)

`currentTerm` in `subjects.js` is worked out from today's date by `computeCurrentTerm()`: it moves to the next semester on 15 March and 15 September, just after each exam period ends. You don't need to change it. Exam dates in `subjects.js` are always read as belonging to `currentTerm`.

### Step 3 — Update the subject timetable

In `subjects.js`, update each subject's `lecture` and `exam` fields from the new PDF.

```js
{ 
    id: '16', 
    name: 'Insolvency',
    type: 'Elective',
    terms: ['Winter'],
    lecture: 'Wednesday',       // ← update from new schedule
    exam: '4 Mar 2027, 1.45 pm' // ← update from new timetable
}
```

- If a subject is **not offered** in the new term, set `exam: null`. The engine will skip it for clash detection and show its archived date instead.
- The `terms` array (`['Winter']`, `['Summer']`, or `['Winter', 'Summer']`) controls which semesters a subject can be added to. Update this if LPAB changes availability.
- Exam date format must be `'D Mon YYYY, H.MM am/pm'` (e.g., `'3 Mar 2027, 9.00 am'`). This is what `datetime.js` parses — any other format shows as "Exam date unrecognized" on the board and is left out of clash detection.
- Until the new exam timetable is published, leave every `exam` as `null`. The board shows "Last ran" dates from `archive.js`, and possible clashes are flagged from past timetables.

## For LLMs and Agents

If you are an LLM or agent working on this repository:

- **Always work from the modular source files** listed in the Project Structure above
- **Do not read or modify** `html file version/LPABPlannerApp.html` unless explicitly instructed — it is a stale snapshot
- **`planner.js` is a shim** — it only re-exports from `js/state/planner-state.js`. Do not add logic to it
- **One module, one concern** — if a change touches more than one module's responsibility, question whether the separation is still clean
- **Exam date format is strict** — `datetime.js` expects `'D Mon YYYY, H.MM am/pm'`. Do not change this format in `subjects.js` without updating the parser
